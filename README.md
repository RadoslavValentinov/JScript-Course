# JScript-Course
In the "Java Script" course, I got basic knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and writing functions. Working and manipulating the DOM tree in addition and working with events. As well as basic concepts of transmission of data via HTTP and REST.
